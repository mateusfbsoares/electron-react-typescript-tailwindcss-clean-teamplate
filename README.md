# electron-react-typescript-tailwindcss-clean-teamplate

- created with electron forge
- tailwindcss is not integrated to the core. It can be used, however, with the new CLI tool
  - npx tailwindcss -o ./src/tailwind.css
  - npx tailwindcss -o ./src/tailwind.css --jit --purge "./\*_/_.html" <-- this doesn't work for some reason
